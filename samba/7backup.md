Copying and configuring `samba_backup` script
----
By default, `samba_backup` script is not included in samba installed scripts. You should copy it from samba source.
```bash
cp /root/samba-4.4.5/source4/scripting/bin/samba_backup /usr/local/samba/bin/
```
After that, set backup destination folder by changing `WHERE=` line in the script:
```bash
vim /usr/local/samba/bin/samba_backup
```
Change `WHERE=` line based on your choice:
```
WHERE=/root/backups
```
Finally make that directory:
```bash
mkdir /root/backups
```
