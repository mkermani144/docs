Provisioning samba
----
```bash
samba-tool domain provision --use-rfc2307 --interactive
```
You will see the program asks you for realm, domain, etc.
```
Realm: department.net
Domain [department]: # Enter
Server Role (dc, member, standalone) [dc]: # Enter
DNS backend (SAMBA_INTERNAL, BIND9_FLATFILE, BIND9_DLZ, NONE) [SAMBA_INTERNAL]: [SAMBA_INTERNAL]: # Enter
DNS forwarder IP address (write 'none' to disable forwarding) [*.*.*.*]: # Enter
Administrator password: # Type in your password
Retype password: # Retype password
...
...
```
At the end, you should see something like this:
```
Server Role:           active directory domain controller
Hostname:              dept
NetBIOS Domain:        DEPARTMENT
DNS Domain:            department.net
DOMAIN SID:            S-1-5-*-*-*-*
```
Ensure that provisioning has been done successfully via the following command:
```bash
smbclient //localhost/netlogon -UAdministrator -c 'ls'
```
The command should return something like this:
```
Domain=[DEPARTMENT] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.4.5]
